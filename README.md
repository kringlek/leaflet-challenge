# leaflet-challenge

This code visualizes earthquake data.  Data was pulled from USGS GeoJSON webpage, which offers multiple dataset options regarding earthquakes. Data was imported and a visual was created using leaflet.  The final outcome was a street and topography map with dots in the locations of where earthquakes occurred.  Data markers reflect magnitude by size and depth by color.  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger, and earthquakes with greater depth are darker in color. A legend and popups with information per marker were also created.
